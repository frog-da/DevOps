# Docker Best Practices

- Use a specific Go version: Specify the Go version explicitly in your base image. For example, `golang:1.21`. This ensures consistency across different environments and avoids potential issues with compatibility.

- Create a non-root user: Use the `useradd` command to create a non-root user within the container. Running the application as a non-root user helps improve security by minimizing the potential impact of security vulnerabilities.

- Set the working directory: Use the `WORKDIR` instruction to set the working directory inside the container to an appropriate location. This helps organize your files and simplifies subsequent commands.

- Copy the application code: Use the `COPY` instruction to copy the application code into the container. This ensures that the necessary files are available for building and running the application.

- Use multi-stage builds: Employ multi-stage builds to separate the build environment from the runtime environment. This helps reduce the size of the final Docker image and improves efficiency.
